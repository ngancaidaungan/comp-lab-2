Concept:
	1.RMI is object oriented RPC mechanism like CORBA(Common Object Request Broker Architecture).
	2.It is used to call remote methods using an object oriented approach.
	3.Server creates a remotely referentiable object and registers in the RMI registry.
	4.When the client needs to call any remote method, it looks for a object in the RMI registry(Binds objects with Names).
	5.When the object is found, a reference proxy is created and you can call any remote method using that reference object.
	6.It is generally used for more complex applications than pure client-server applications
===>7.See the .pdf file and also the link <http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~cs379/DistributedSystems/rmi_tut.html> for more information on 		  RMI.

How to run it ?

step 1:
	-- start the rmiregistry :
	rmiregistry &
	
step 2:
	-- compile all .java files <ATM.java, ATMClient.java, ATMServer.java>
	javac ATM.java
	javac ATMClient.java
	java ATMServer.java

step 3:
	--Run the RMI server:
	java ATMServer
	
step 4:
	--Run the Client(in separate terminal)
	java ATMClient
	
	
	Note: <init> function initializes your balance<do it first> e.g. init 1000
		  <withdraw> : get some money		e.g. withdraw 800
		  <check-balance> : what is left ?  e.g. check-balance
